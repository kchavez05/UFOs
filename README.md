# We're Not Alone
## UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to use Javascript and HTML to build a filterable table of data on UFO sightings.  

### Results
When a user goes to the website they will be greeted with a splash page which will display the entire table of data.

The user is then able to input seach criteria - either one field or multiple fields:
#### Single Field

#### Multiple Fields

### Summary
Although this site is intuitive and easy to use, the data is presented without much context and it's a very limited dataset.  The dataset certainly needs to be expanded and links to additional resources and supporting documents should be provided.  Additionally, the filters could be improved so that the user could search between two dates, or even by multiple locations.
